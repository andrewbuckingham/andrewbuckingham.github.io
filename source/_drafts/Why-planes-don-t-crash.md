title: Why planes don't crash

Best start with two caveats.

First, yes, planes sometimes *do* crash. And second, there's *lots* of reasons why they mostly don't.

I recently discovered a simple human design factor that contributes to aircraft safety—and realised I could borrow the same idea for my own purposes.

# Just how safe, exactly?

It's often said that commercial air travel is one of the safest things you can do; but it's so incredibly safe that the odds are hard to comprehend. If you took a commercial jet airliner flight in 2022, your chance of a fatal crash was 1 in 5.8 million[^1].

It's 1 in 5.8 million because only 1 jet crashed from a total of 5.8 million flights. There's no such thing as "half a jet," so it's pretty hard to get much lower than that. Other than absolutely zero. (Mathematicians: you can start reading again now.)

# People problems

Aircraft safety isn't just from good engineering or technology. The biggest risk is the people operating the aircraft, and that's why commercial flying is so safe: iteratively honing the human processes to the point where they're near-infallible.

Added to this, very few airliner crashes are due to a single factor. Usually *two* things have to go wrong at the same time[^2]. Perhaps a smaller initial issue distracts the pilot from a secondary one. The distraction means that their *situational awareness* becomes reduced.

How do you improve situational awareness? Let's think about the simplest electronic device in an aircraft: plain old *switches*.

# Switching mindset

Switches are really simple: something's either On or Not. What's to go wrong?

Obviously the complexity comes from the *quantity* of switches. It's easy to spot that one switch is "On" where it should be "Off". If there are hundreds, then less so.

This challenge was addressed by the European aerospace manufacturer, Airbus. They have pioneered a principle to make the hundreds of switches much simpler for a pilot to understand. It's called "Dark Cockpit," and we can demonstrate it here.

First, let's look at some cockpit switches from the other big name in airliner manufacturer—the one everyone's heard of. I've deliberately set some of these switches incorrectly. Can you spot which one? Don't spend too long...
